# Kubernetes Prometheus Monitoring: Metrics, Scrape and Installation with Helm

Kubernetes **monitoring** is a method of examining and reporting the health status of cluster components. So, the process helps track the utilisation of cluster resources, including memory, CPU, and storage. And, talking of open-source tools like Prometheus for Kubernetes monitoring and Grafana for visualising have become the numero uno go-to tools!

Let’s look at the topics discussed in this post:

## 1. Kubernetes Monitoring

![Kubernetes Monitoring](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/API_MatricsServer-1-1.png)

The challenge with Kubernetes comes from the managing of high availability, performance, and deployment of containers. But, what is more, the challenge is also to monitor them. Thankfully, K8s comes up with Metrics. The CAdvisor, installed by default on all cluster nodes, collects containers like CPU, memory, network, and disk usage. These metrics are pushed into the Metric Server of Kubernetes by the kubelet APIs.

Kubernetes eases the management of our containerised applications and services. It can sometimes be a two-edged sword, as it adds complexity to the system with the influx of new layers and abstractions. Hence, it makes a long list of components to monitor.

But to our rescue, there are many excelling open-source tools in today’s world to help us get through with the monitoring.

## 2. Kubernetes Dashboard

The web-based [Kubernetes console](https://k21academy.com/docker-kubernetes/kubernetes-dashboard/), which is a general-purpose UI made to look after the ***Cluster*** in Kubernetes. Surprisingly, even the dashboard is nothing but a **container** that access the cluster information from within the cluster. So, it’s just another resource for Kubernetes to manage.

## 3. What is Prometheus?

An open-source monitoring tool, Prometheus seems to be the *King* 👑 of all the monitoring tools out there as of today. Prometheus on Kubernetes is used for metrics-based monitoring and alerting. It pulls the real-time metrics, compresses and stores them in a time-series database.

The Prometheus sends an HTTP request (pull) called ***Scrape***, found on the configuration in the deployment. It provides a query language and a robust data model that provides detailed and actionable metrics.

Let’s look at how is Prometheus built from the inside.

### 1. Prometheus Architecture

At its core, Prometheus has a main component called **Prometheus Server**, responsible for the actual monitoring work. The Prometheus server consists of:

- **Time Series Database** that stores all the metric data like current CPU usage, memory usage etc.
- **Data Retrieval Worker** is responsible for all the data pulling activities from applications, services, servers etc. and pushing them into the database.
- **HTTP Server API** meant to accept queries for the stored data. The Server API is used to display the data in a dashboard or a Web UI.

![Prometheus architecture](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prometheus-Server_Chart.png)

Prometheus Architecture

These three components together are the ones behind that scene that helps keep our K8s clusters healthy and perform the best.

### 3. How does Prometheus work with Kubernetes?

Prometheus on Kubernetes monitors a ‘thing’, for instance, Linux/Windows server, an application, Apache server, service like a database. These are called the ***Targets***.

**![Prometheus Grafana working](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prometheus-Server.png)**

Working of Prometheus

#### 1.Metrics

The units monitored from these targets can be like the current CPU usage, memory usage, the number of counts of a request or an exception. These units are called ***Metrics***. They are in a human-readable text-based format with *TYPE* and *HELP* attributes. The **HELP** attributes description of what the metrics are.

There are three types of metrics **TYPES** named:

1. **Counter***:* Tells us about how many times ‘x’ happened. It can be like the number of times an exception occurred or the number of requests.
2. **Gauge**: It represents a metric that can go up and down. So, it gives us the value of ‘x’. An ‘x’ can be the current CPU usage, disk usage etc.
3. **Histogram**: This type tracks the duration or the size of requests or any required metric.

Prometheus on Kubernetes pulls metrics data from the targets. They pull data from HTTP endpoints like the host address/metrics. So, for this to work, the targets should expose their /metrics endpoint, and the data at the endpoint must be acceptable by Prometheus. But, not every service exposes their /metrics endpoint by default. So, then comes the **Exporter**. It is a script that does help the Prometheus server retrieve the metrics by doing the following work:

1. Pulls the metrics from the target.
2. Converts it into the Prometheus readable format.
3. Exposes the /metrics endpoints.

So, these exporters help you scrape metrics when required and are readily available. There are many official Prometheus exporters for services like MySQL, Linux server, cloud platforms, etc. You can check it out from ***[here](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)*** 👈

#### 2. Alerts Manager

The Prometheus has another component that alerts in a failure in the cluster, resource limitations etc. The Alert Manager is responsible for firing alerts via a different medium like Slack, email, etc.

#### 3. Prometheus Data Storage

Prometheus on Kubernetes collects and aggregates all the data in a disk. So, it involves local storage but can also connect with remote storage. But we can’t directly store the pulled data on a relational database since it is in a **custom time-series format**.

#### 4. Prometheus Querying

Once the data gets stored in the database, we can query the data using PromQL. The Prometheus web UI, ***Grafana*** are the tools that help us visualise data.

Most of the monitoring mechanisms like Amazon Cloud Watch pushes the data to a centralised collection platform. But, this doesn’t seem ideal for microservices because of the traffic it might cause. Hence, the Prometheus uses the **pull system** from which retrieves data via multiple Prometheus instances and helps better detect a status of a service. However, Prometheus offers the push mechanism for ‘short-lived jobs’.

## 3. What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source mighty visualisation and analytics software. It helps us visualise massive amounts of data with the help of an excellent customisable dashboard. Therefore it helps us study, monitor, and analyse data over a period of time. It connects with a lot of data source like Prometheus, Graphite, Influx DB, ElasticSearch etc.

### Features of Grafana

- **The Dashboard**: It is quite an excelling feature with well equipped and continually evolving part. The dashboard helps us make sense of complex data.
- **Alerts**: The alerts can be set up and fired whenever there is an anticipated situation.
- **Native Support**: It has native support of around a dozen databases.
- **Built-in Support**: It offers built-in support for Prometheus, Influx DB, CloudWatch, Graphite, ElasticSearch.

## 4. Install Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes

So, we finally have arrived at the most exciting part of the blog. Yes, we are going to install Prometheus Kubernetes with a Grafana web UI. But, before we get started, let’s look at some of the prerequisites.

i) You should have a **Kubernetes cluster** up and running. It can be of any number of nodes, ***minikube\*** ***cluster*** would also do.

If you don’t have one, check out how to create a **three-node** [**Kubernetes cluster**](https://k21academy.com/docker-kubernetes/how-to-setup-a-three-node-kubernetes-cluster-for-cka-step-by-step/). But, don’t forget to get back here 😉

ii) [**Helm**](https://k21academy.com/docker-kubernetes/helm-and-helm-charts-with-kubernetes/) package manager should be installed on your machine or the Kubernetes cluster. If not, don’t worry. We got you all covered. You can install from the below commands.

**For Linux:**

```shell
  curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
  echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install helm
```

**For Windows:**

```cmd
 choco install kubernetes-helm
```

**For macOS:**

```shell
  brew install helm
```

**From pkg (FreeBSD):**

```shell
  pkg install helm
```

### **Step 1: Add repositories**

Add the following helm repositories by the commands below.

```shell
  helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

![Prometheus helm repo](Peek-2021-05-31-15-01.gif)

```shell
  helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
```

![prometheus stable repo](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1.gif)

### **Step 2: Update Helm repositories**

After we add the helm repositories, we have to update the helm repo by the following command.

```
  helm repo update
```

![helm repo update](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker-3.gif)

### **Step 3: Install Prometheus Kubernetes**

```
  helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

![helm install prometheus](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker-9.gif)

### **Step 4: Kubernetes Prometheus Port Forward**

```
  kubectl port-forward deployment/prometheus-grafana 3000
```

![grafana port forward](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker-5.gif)

### **Step 5: Log in to Grafana**

Open your favourite browser and open [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/). Since you are logging in for the first time, you will have to use a default username and password. However, you can create new users and update passwords later. Use the default credentials for now:

**username**: admin
**password**: prom-operator

![kubernetes prometheus grafana login](ezgif.com-gif-maker-11.gif)

Once you are inside the Grafana web UI, there are a lot of things you can do. You can set the duration of scraping metrics. You can also configure your dashboard. Also, you can look into networking. However, there are a lot more things to explore in this. I am adding some of the scouting done by me below.

**Networking in a pod:**

## **Conclusion**

Monitoring is crucial whether you are experimenting or using the production-based cluster. Prometheus Kubernetes monitoring with Grafana is a boon for us indeed. It makes our lives a lot easier with a customisable interface, configurable exporters. Also, it is open-source. However, K8s has its official dashboard, and the Prometheus + Grafana is no match.

We have used Helm to deploy the Prometheus operator, including all the necessary tools for Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the cluster. So, you would have figured out why Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes are a superpower. If no yet, I suggest you install the Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes and have a look at the various features it has to offer for us!
